Given two 1d vectors, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.
<!--more-->
### Example
Given two 1d vectors:

`v1` = `[1, 2]`
`v2` = `[3, 4, 5, 6]`

By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: `[1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6]`.

### Follow up
What if you are given k 1d vectors? How well can your code be extended to such cases?
